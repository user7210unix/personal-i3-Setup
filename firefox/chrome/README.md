# Firefox config
My setup for firefox.

- `userChrome.css` contains browser styling for firefox
- `autoconfig.js` and `autoconfig.cfg` allow me to change my default new tab to a custom startpage. The one I use is located in this repository (`startpage/`).

Information about where to put these files for use in firefox can be found in the docs.
